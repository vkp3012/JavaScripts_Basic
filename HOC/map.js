// The map() function in JavaScript is a higher-order function that takes a callback function as an argument and returns a new array with the results of calling that callback function on every element in the original array. The callback function is called with three arguments: the current element being processed, the index of the current element, and the original array. The map() function does not modify the original array, but instead returns a new array with the modified values. 

// Here's an example:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function(number) {
  return number * 2;
});

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
