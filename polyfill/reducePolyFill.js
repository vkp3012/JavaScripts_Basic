// what is Reduce Function?
// The `reduce()` function is a higher-order function commonly found in many programming languages, including Python. It is used to apply a specific operation or function to a sequence of elements, typically resulting in a single value. The purpose of `reduce()` is to "reduce" a collection of values to a single output by repeatedly applying the provided function.

// The general syntax of the `reduce()` function is as follows:

// ```
// reduce(function, sequence)
// ```

// Here's how it works:

// 1. The `function` parameter represents the operation or function that will be applied to the elements of the `sequence`.
// 2. The `sequence` parameter is the collection of elements on which the operation will be performed.

// The `reduce()` function performs the following steps:

// 1. It takes the first two elements from the `sequence` and applies the provided `function` to them, producing a single result.
// 2. Then, it takes this result and the next element from the `sequence` and applies the `function` to them, again producing a new result.
// 3. It repeats this process, using the result of the previous step and the next element from the `sequence` until all elements have been processed.
// 4. Finally, it returns the last result obtained after applying the `function` to all elements in the `sequence`.

// Here's a simple example to illustrate the usage of the `reduce()` function in Python, assuming you have a list of numbers:

// ```python
// from func tools import reduce

// numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// # Calculate the sum of all numbers using reduce()
// sum_result = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)
// print(sum_result)  # Output: 15
// ```

// In this example, the `reduce()` function is used to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list. The `lambda` function `(lambda x, y: x + y)` represents the addition operation. `reduce()` applies this function to the elements of the list one by one, resulting in the final sum of 15.

// It's important to note that in Python, the `reduce()` function is available in the `functools` module, so you need to import it before using `reduce()`.
